"# House Prices Regression" 

This notebook was the second machine learning project I did. It was part of a competition on the machine learning website Kaggle.

The goal of the competition was to develop a model that minimize the RMSLE on the prediction of the sale price of a house in Iowa. With a RMSLE of 0.1139, this model would be in the top 2% of all the models that were submitted.
